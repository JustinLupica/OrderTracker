# Order Tracker App

> Welcome! This app was built to help out a small family business to track all their orders, store them in a secure SQL Database, and enter customer information and product information. When an order is placed, the user is able to associate product(s), and a customer to the order. This way, the user can see how many orders a customer has, what products they are ordering, and what orders are coming up to fulfill and past orders as well.
